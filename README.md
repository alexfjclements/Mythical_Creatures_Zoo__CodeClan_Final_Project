# Mythical_Creatures_Zoo__CodeClan_Final_Project

This project represents a collaboration between 5 CodeClan students for our
final project of the course. It consists of a Java back end api and a JavaScript
front end built using React. To run the project, open the IntelliJ IDE from the demo folder within the project root folder. In IntelliJ, build and run the file
MythicalCreaturesApplication.java. This will run the API. Within demo/mythical_creatures_zoo
in Terminal run npm install, followed by npm start. This will run the project itself on
localhost:3000
